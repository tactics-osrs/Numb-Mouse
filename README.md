## Numb Mouse
Numb Mouse is a script that allows you to control your mouse using the number pad on your keyboard. It’s designed to improve accessibility and ease of use. I made it due to issues I encountered
with my mouse having intermittent connection issues, so that I still have full control of my mouse if/when it goes out.

## What the Code Does
The script remaps certain keys on your number pad to mouse actions. Here’s what each key does:

* Numpad8: Moves the mouse upward.
* Numpad2: Moves the mouse downward.
* Numpad4: Moves the mouse to the left.
* Numpad6: Moves the mouse to the right.
* Numpad5: Acts as the left mouse button.
* NumpadAdd (+): Acts as the right mouse button.
*Additionally, the End key toggles the script on and off.
* Esc: Closes the script.

## Versions
There are two Versions of Numb Mouse:

* .ahk Version: This version requires AutoHotkey to be installed on your computer. You can download AutoHotkey from its official website. Once installed, you can run the .ahk version of Numb Mouse.

* .exe Version: This is a compiled version of the script, which means it can run on its own without the need for any additional software. Simply double-click the .exe file to run Numb Mouse.

Please choose the version that best suits your needs. Enjoy using Numb Mouse!
