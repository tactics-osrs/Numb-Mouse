## Numb Mouse

Numb Mouse is a script that allows you to control your mouse using the number pad on your keyboard. It’s designed to improve accessibility and ease of use. I made it due to issues I encountered with my mouse having intermittent connection issues, so that I still have full control of my mouse if/when it goes out.

## What the Code Does

The script remaps certain keys on your number pad to mouse actions. Here’s what each key does:

* **Numpad8**: Moves the mouse upward. If Numpad4 or Numpad6 is also pressed, the mouse moves diagonally upward to the left or right, respectively.
* **Numpad2**: Moves the mouse downward. If Numpad4 or Numpad6 is also pressed, the mouse moves diagonally downward to the left or right, respectively.
* **Numpad4**: Moves the mouse to the left. If Numpad8 or Numpad2 is also pressed, the mouse moves diagonally upward or downward to the left, respectively.
* **Numpad6**: Moves the mouse to the right. If Numpad8 or Numpad2 is also pressed, the mouse moves diagonally upward or downward to the right, respectively.
* **Numpad5**: Acts as the left mouse button.
* **NumpadAdd (+)**: Acts as the right mouse button.
* **End**: Toggles the script on and off.
* **Esc**: Closes the script.

## Versions

There are two versions of Numb Mouse:

* **.ahk Version**: This version requires AutoHotkey to be installed on your computer. You can download AutoHotkey from its official website. Once installed, you can run the .ahk version of Numb Mouse.

* **.exe Version**: This is a compiled version of the script, which means it can run on its own without the need for any additional software. Simply double-click the .exe file to run Numb Mouse.

Please choose the version that best suits your needs. Enjoy using Numb Mouse!
I've added comments to most lines in the code, just in-case you wanted to modify it to fit your needs!
